# microjs
Language resembling Java Script suitable for embedded systems

Deep embedded systems with stringent memory and CPU resources --- sometimes with few kilobytes of RAM memory and dozens of kilobytes of FLASH --- takes full advantage of a fast compiled language like µJS for scripting, allowing the users to extend the functionality of some devices. Examples of such applications are all sort of controllers industrial or otherwise, measurement instruments ... .

µJS --- pronounced as micro J S --- is a programming language most commonly used for scripting embedded applications running on small micro-controllers. In this sense it is not a general-purpose programming language like C++ or Java. For this reason µJS is limited in its capabilities and but this is intentional. It should noted that µJS's syntax resembles JavaScript, hence the JS in the name. This fact can be used tho help editing programs by enabling syntax highlighting in text editors having this feature. JavaScript is mentioned several times in this document either to point similarities or differences between these two languages.
